  "Quantitative": "Quantitative research is a means for testing objective theories by examining the relationship among variables. These variables, in turn, can be measured, typically on instruments, so that numbered data can be analyzed using statistical procedures. The final written report has a set structure consisting of introduction, literature and theory, methods, results, and discussion\n(Creswell, 2008). During the late 19th and throughout the 20th century, strategies of inquiry associated with quantitative research were those that invoked the postpositivist worldview. These include true experiments and the less rigorous experiments called quasi-experiments and correlational studies (Campbell & Stanley, 1963) and specific single-subject experiments (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 1987; Neuman & McCormick, 1995). More recently, quantitative strategies have involved complex experiments with many variables and treatments (e.g., factorial designs and repeated measure designs). They have also included elaborate structural equation models that incorporate causal paths and the identification of the collective strength of multiple variables. In this book, I focus on two strategies of inquiry: surveys and experiments.\n• Survey research provides a quantitative or numeric description of trends, attitudes, or opinions of a population by studying a sample of that population. It includes cross-sectional and longitudinal studies using questionnaires or structured interviews for data collection, with the intent of generalizing from a sample to a population (Babbie, 1990).\n• Experimental research seeks to determine if a specific treatment influences an outcome. This impact is assessed by providing a specific treatment to one group and withholding it from another and then determining how both groups scored on an outcome. Experiments include true experiments, with the random assignment of subjects to treatment conditions, and quasi- experiments that use nonrandomized designs (Keppel, 1991). Included within quasi- experiments are single-subject designs. Quantitative approach—Postpositivist worldview, experimental strategy of inquiry, and pre- and post-test measures of attitudes\nIn this scenario, the researcher tests a theory by specifying narrow hypotheses and the collection of data to support or refute the hypotheses. An experimental design is used in which attitudes are assessed both before and after an experimental treatment. The data are collected on an instrument that measures attitudes, and the information is analyzed using statistical procedures and hypothesis testing.  Researchers use theory in a quantitative study to provide an explanation or prediction about the relationship among variables in the study. Thus, it is essential to have grounding in the nature and use of variables as they form research questions and hypotheses. A theory explains how and why the variables are related, acting as a bridge between or among the variables. Theory may be broad or narrow in scope, and researchers state their theories in several ways, such as a series of hypotheses, if-then logic statements, or visual models. Using theories deductively, investigators advance them at the beginning of the study in the literature review. They also include them with the hypotheses or research questions or place them in a separate section. A script can help design the theory section for a research proposal. A survey design provides a quantitative or numeric description of trends, attitudes, or opinions of a population by studying a sample of that population. From sample results, the researcher generalizes or makes claims about the population. In an experiment, investigators may also identify a sample and generalize to a population; however, the basic intent of an experimental design is to test the impact of a treatment (or an intervention) on an outcome, controlling for all other factors that might influence that outcome. As one form of control, researchers randomly assign individuals to groups. When one group receives a treatment and the other group does not, the experimenter can isolate whether it is the treatment and not other factors that influence the outcome.\nCOMPONENTS OF A SURVEY METHOD PLAN\nThe design of a survey method section follows a standard format. Numerous examples of this format appear in scholarly journals, and these examples provide useful models. The following sections detail typical components. In preparing to design these components into a proposal, consider the questions on the checklist shown in Table 8.1 as a general guide.\nThe Survey Design\nIn a proposal or plan, one of the first parts of the method section can introduce readers to the basic purpose and rationale for survey research. Begin the discussion by reviewing the purpose of a survey and the rationale for its selection for the proposed study. This discussion can\n• Identify the purpose of survey research. This purpose is to generalize from a sample to a population so that inferences can be made about some characteristic, attitude, or behavior of this population (Babbie, 1990). Provide a reference to this purpose from one of the survey method texts (several are identified in this chapter).\n• Indicate why a survey is the preferred type of data collection procedure for the study. In this rationale, consider the advantages of survey designs, such as the economy of the design and the rapid turnaround in data collection. Discuss the advantage of identifying attributes of a large population from a small group of individuals (Babbie, 1990; Fowler, 2002).\n• Indicate whether the survey will be cross-sectional, with the data collected at one point in time, or whether it will be longitudinal, with data collected over time.\n• Specify the form of data collection. Fink (2002) identifies four types: self-administered questionnaires; interviews; structured record reviews to collect financial, medical, or school information; and structured observations. The data collection may also involve creating a Web- based or Internet survey and administering it online (Nesbary, 2000; Sue & Ritter, 2007). Regardless of the form of data collection, provide a rationale for the procedure, using arguments based on its strengths and weaknesses, costs, data availability, and convenience.\n\n\n The Population and Sample\nSpecify the characteristics of the population and the sampling procedure. Methodologists have written excellent discussions about the underlying logic of sampling theory (e.g., Babbie, 1990, 2007). Here are essential aspects of the population and sample to describe in a research plan:\n• Identify the population in the study. Also state the size of this population, if size can be determined, and the means of identifying individuals in the population. Questions of access arise here, and the researcher might refer to availability of sampling frames—mail or published lists—of potential respondents in the population.\n• Identify whether the sampling design for this population is single stage or multistage (called clustering). Cluster sampling is ideal when it is impossible or impractical to compile a list of the elements composing the population (Babbie, 2007). A single-stage sampling procedure is one in which the researcher has access to names in the population and can sample the people (or other elements) directly. In a multistage or clustering procedure, the researcher first identifies\n\nclusters (groups or organizations), obtains names of individuals within those clusters, and then samples within them.\n• Identify the selection process for individuals. I recommend selecting a random sample, in which each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected (a systematic or probabilistic sample). Less desirable is a nonprobability sample (or convenience sample), in which respondents are chosen based on their convenience and availability (Babbie, 1990). With randomization, a representative sample from a population provides the ability to generalize to a population.\n• Identify whether the study will involve stratification of the population before selecting the sample. Stratification means that specific characteristics of individuals (e.g., both females and males) are represented in the sample and the sample reflects the true proportion in the population of individuals with certain characteristics (Fowler, 2002). When randomly selecting people from a population, these characteristics may or may not be present in the sample in the same proportions as in the population; stratification ensures their representation. Also identify the characteristics used in stratifying the population (e.g., gender, income levels, education). Within each stratum, identify whether the sample contains individuals with the characteristic in the same proportion as the characteristic appears in the entire population (Babbie, 1990; Miller, 1991).\n• Discuss the procedures for selecting the sample from available lists. The most rigorous method for selecting the sample is to choose individuals using a random numbers table, a table available in many introductory statistics texts (e.g., Gravetter & Wallnau, 2000).\n• Indicate the number of people in the sample and the procedures used to compute this number. In survey research, I recommend that one use a sample size formula available in many survey texts (e.g., see Babbie, 1990; Fowler, 2002).\nInstrumentation\nAs part of rigorous data collection, the proposal developer also provides detailed information about the actual survey instrument to be used in the proposed study. Consider the following:\n• Name the survey instrument used to collect data. Discuss whether it is an instrument designed for this research, a modified instrument, or an intact instrument developed by someone else. If it is a modified instrument, indicate whether the developer has provided appropriate permission to use it. In some survey projects, the researcher assembles an instrument from components of several instruments. Again, permission to use any part of other instruments needs to be obtained. In addition, instruments are being increasingly designed for online surveys (see Sue & Ritter, 2007). An online survey tool is SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey.com), a commercial product available since 1999. Using this service, researchers can create their own surveys quickly using custom templates and post them on Web sites or e-mail them for participants to complete. SurveyMonkey then can generate results and report them back to the researcher as descriptive statistics or as graphed information. The results can be downloaded into a spreadsheet or a database for further analysis. The basic program is free for 100 responses per survey and no more than 10 questions per survey. For additional responses, more questions, and several custom features, SurveyMonkey charges a monthly or annual fee.\n• To use an existing instrument, describe the established validity and reliability of scores obtained from past use of the instrument. This means reporting efforts by authors to establish\n \nvalidity—whether one can draw meaningful and useful inferences from scores on the instruments. The three traditional forms of validity to look for are content validity (do the items measure the content they were intended to measure?), predictive or concurrent validity (do scores predict a criterion measure? Do results correlate with other results?), and construct validity (do items measure hypothetical constructs or concepts?). In more recent studies, construct validity has also included whether the scores serve a useful purpose and have positive consequences when they are used in practice (Humbley & Zumbo, 1996). Establishing the validity of the scores in a survey helps to identify whether an instrument might be a good one to use in survey research. This form of validity is different than identifying the threats to validity in experimental research, as discussed later in this chapter.\nAlso discuss whether scores resulting from past use of the instrument demonstrate reliability. Look for whether authors report measures of internal consistency (are the items’ responses consistent across constructs?) and test-retest correlations (are scores stable over time when the instrument is administered a second time?). Also determine whether there was consistency in test administration and scoring (were errors caused by carelessness in administration or scoring?; Borg, Gall, & Gall, 1993).\n• When one modifies an instrument or combines instruments in a study, the original validity and reliability may not hold for the new instrument, and it becomes important to reestablish validity and reliability during data analysis.\n• Include sample items from the instrument so that readers can see the actual items used. In an appendix to the proposal, attach sample items or the entire instrument.\n• Indicate the major content sections in the instrument, such as the cover letter (Dillman, 1978, provides a useful list of items to include in cover letters), the items (e.g., demographics, attitudinal items, behavioral items, factual items), and the closing instructions. Also mention the type of scales used to measure the items on the instrument, such as continuous scales (e.g., strongly agree to strongly disagree) and categorical scales (e.g., yes/no, rank from highest to lowest importance).\n• Discuss plans for pilot testing or field testing the survey and provide a rationale for these plans. This testing is important to establish the content validity of an instrument and to improve questions, format, and scales. Indicate the number of people who will test the instrument and the plans to incorporate their comments into final instrument revisions.\n• For a mailed survey, identify steps for administering the survey and for following up to ensure a high response rate. Salant and Dillman (1994) suggest a four-phase administration process. The first mail-out is a short advance-notice letter to all members of the sample, and the second mail-out is the actual mail survey, distributed about 1 week after the advance-notice letter. The third mail-out consists of a postcard follow-up sent to all members of the sample 4 to 8 days after the initial questionnaire. The fourth mail-out, sent to all nonrespondents, consists of a personalized cover letter with a handwritten signature, the questionnaire, and a preaddressed return envelope with postage. Researchers send this fourth mail-out 3 weeks after the second mail-out. Thus, in total, the researcher concludes the administration period 4 weeks after its start, providing the returns meet project objectives.\nVariables in the Study\nAlthough readers of a proposal learn about the variables in purpose statements and research questions/hypotheses sections, it is useful in the method section to relate the variables to the\n\nspecific questions or hypotheses on the instrument. One technique is to relate the variables, the research questions or hypotheses, and items on the survey instrument so that a reader can easily determine how the researcher will use the questionnaire items. Plan to include a table and a discussion that cross-reference the variables, the questions or hypotheses, and specific survey items. This procedure is especially helpful in dissertations in which investigators test large-scale models. Table 8.2 illustrates such a table using hypothetical data.\nTable 8.2 Variables, Research Questions, and Items on a Survey\nData Analysis and Interpretation\nIn the proposal, present information about the steps involved in analyzing the data. I recommend the following research tips, presenting them as a series of steps so that a reader can see how one step leads to another for a complete discussion of the data analysis procedures.\nStep 1. Report information about the number of members of the sample who did and did not return the survey. A table with numbers and percentages describing respondents and nonrespondents is a useful tool to present this information.\nStep 2. Discuss the method by which response bias will be determined. Response bias is the effect of nonresponses on survey estimates (Fowler, 2002). Bias means that if nonrespondents had responded, their responses would have substantially changed the overall results. Mention the procedures used to check for response bias, such as wave analysis or a respondent/nonrespondent analysis. In wave analysis, the researcher examines returns on select items week by week to determine if average responses change (Leslie, 1972). Based on the assumption that those who return surveys in the final weeks of the response period are\n \nnearly all nonrespondents, if the responses begin to change, a potential exists for response bias. An alternative check for response bias is to contact a few nonrespondents by phone and determine if their responses differ substantially from respondents. This constitutes a respondent-nonrespondent check for response bias.\nStep 3. Discuss a plan to provide a descriptive analysis of data for all independent and dependent variables in the study. This analysis should indicate the means, standard deviations, and range of scores for these variables.\nStep 4. If the proposal contains an instrument with scales or a plan to develop scales (combining items into scales), identify the statistical procedure (i.e., factor analysis) for accomplishing this. Also mention reliability checks for the internal consistency of the scales (i.e., the Cronbach alpha statistic).\nStep 5. Identify the statistics and the statistical computer program for testing the major inferential research questions or hypotheses in the proposed study. The inferential questions or hypotheses relate variables or compare groups in terms of variables so that inferences can be drawn from the sample to a population. Provide a rationale for the choice of statistical test and mention the assumptions associated with the statistic. As shown in Table 8.3, base this choice on the nature of the research question (e.g., relating variables or comparing groups as the most popular), the number of independent and dependent variables, and the number of variables controlled (e.g., see Rudestam & Newton, 2007). Further, consider whether the variables will be measured on an instrument as a continuous score (e.g., age, from 18 to 36) or as a categorical score (e.g., women = 1, men = 2). Finally, consider whether the scores from the sample might be normally distributed in a bell-shaped curve if plotted out on a graph or non- normally distributed. There are additional ways to determine if the scores are normally distributed (see Creswell, 2008). These factors, in combination, enable a researcher to determine what statistical test will be suited for answering the research question or hypothesis. In Table 8.3, I show how the factors, in combination, lead to the selection of a number of common statistical tests. For further types of statistical tests, readers are referred to statistics methods books, such as Gravetter and Wallnau (2000).\nStep 6. A final step in the data analysis is to present the results in tables or figures and interpret the results from the statistical test. An interpretation of the results means that the researcher draws conclusions from the results for the research questions, hypotheses, and the larger meaning of the results. This interpretation involves several steps.\n\n",

  "Qualitative": "Qualitative research is a means for exploring and understanding the meaning individuals or groups ascribe to a social or human problem. The process of research involves emerging questions and procedures, data typically collected in the participant’s setting, data analysis inductively building from particulars to general themes, and the researcher making interpretations of the meaning of the data. The final written report has a flexible structure. Those who engage in this form of inquiry support a way of looking at research that honors an inductive style, a focus on individual meaning, and the importance of rendering the complexity of a situation (adapted from Creswell, 2007). In qualitative research, the numbers and types of approaches have also become more clearly visible during the 1990s and into the 21st century. Books have summarized the various types (such as the 19 strategies identified by Wolcott, 2001), and complete procedures are now available on specific qualitative inquiry approaches. For example, Clandinin and Connelly (2000) constructed a picture of what narrative researchers do. Moustakas (1994) discussed the philosophical tenets and the procedures of the phenomenological method, and Strauss and\n \nCorbin (1990, 1998) identified the procedures of grounded theory. Wolcott (1999) summarized ethnographic procedures, and Stake (1995) suggested processes involved in case study research. In this book, illustrations are drawn from the following strategies, recognizing that approaches such as participatory action research (Kemmis & Wilkinson, 1998), discourse analysis (Cheek, 2004), and others not mentioned (see Creswell, 2007b) are also viable ways to conduct qualitative studies:\n• Ethnography is a strategy of inquiry in which the researcher studies an intact cultural group in a natural setting over a prolonged period of time by collecting, primarily, observational and interview data (Creswell, 2007b). The research process is flexible and typically evolves contextually in response to the lived realities encountered in the field setting (LeCompte & Schensul, 1999).\n• Grounded theory is a strategy of inquiry in which the researcher derives a general, abstract theory of a process, action, or interaction grounded in the views of participants. This process involves using multiple stages of data collection and the refinement and interrelationship of categories of information (Charmaz, 2006; Strauss and Corbin, 1990, 1998). Two primary characteristics of this design are the constant comparison of data with emerging categories and theoretical sampling of different groups to maximize the similarities and the differences of information.\n• Case studies are a strategy of inquiry in which the researcher explores in depth a program, event, activity, process, or one or more individuals. Cases are bounded by time and activity, and researchers collect detailed information using a variety of data collection procedures over a sustained period of time (Stake, 1995).\n• Phenomenological research is a strategy of inquiry in which the researcher identifies the essence of human experiences about a phenomenon as described by participants. Understanding the lived experiences marks phenomenology as a philosophy as well as a method, and the procedure involves studying a small number of subjects through extensive and prolonged engagement to develop patterns and relationships of meaning (Moustakas, 1994). In this process, the researcher brackets or sets aside his or her own experiences in order to understand those of the participants in the study (Nieswiadomy, 1993).\n• Narrative research is a strategy of inquiry in which the researcher studies the lives of individuals and asks one or more individuals to provide stories about their lives. This information is then often retold or restoried by the researcher into a narrative chronology. In the end, the narrative combines views from the participant’s life with those of the researcher’s life in a collaborative narrative (Clandinin & Connelly, 2000).  Qualitative approach—Constructivist worldview, ethnographic design, and observation of behavior\n \nIn this situation, the researcher seeks to establish the meaning of a phenomenon from the views of participants. This means identifying a culture-sharing group and studying how it develops shared patterns of behavior over time (i.e., ethnography). One of the key elements of collecting data in this way is to observe participants’ behaviors by engaging in their activities. Qualitative approach—Participatory worldview, narrative design, and open-ended interviewing\nFor this study, the inquirer seeks to examine an issue related to oppression of individuals. To study this, stories are collected of individual oppression using a narrative approach. Individuals are interviewed at some length to determine how they have personally experienced oppression. In qualitative research, inquirers employ theory as a broad explanation, much like in quantitative research, such as in ethnographies. It may also be a theoretical lens or perspective that raises questions related to gender, class, race, or some combination of these. Theory also appears as an end point of a qualitative study, a generated theory, a pattern, or a generalization that emerges inductively from data collection and analysis. Grounded theorists, for example, generate a theory grounded in the views of participants and place it as the conclusion of their studies. Some qualitative studies do not include an explicit theory and present descriptive research of the central phenomenon. \nFor many years, proposal writers had to discuss the characteristics of qualitative research and convince faculty and audiences as to their legitimacy. Now these discussions are less frequently found in the literature and there is some consensus as to what constitutes qualitative inquiry. Thus, my suggestions about this section of a proposal are as follows:\nTable 9.1 A Checklist of Questions for Designing a Qualitative Procedure\n • Review the needs of potential audiences for the proposal. Decide whether audience members are knowledgeable enough about the characteristics of qualitative research that this section is not necessary.\n• If there is some question about their knowledge, present the basic characteristics of qualitative research in the proposal and possibly discuss a recent qualitative research journal article (or study) to use as an example to illustrate the characteristics.\n• Several lists of characteristics might be used (e.g., Bogdan & Biklen, 1992; Eisner, 1991; Hatch, 2002; LeCompte & Schensul, 1999; Marshall & Rossman, 2006), but I will rely on a composite analysis of several of these writers that I incorporated into my book on qualitative inquiry (Creswell, 2007). My list captures both traditional perspectives and the newer advocacy, participatory, and self-reflexive perspectives of qualitative inquiry. Here are the characteristics of qualitative research, presented in no specific order of importance:\n• Natural setting—Qualitative researchers tend to collect data in the field at the site where participants experience the issue or problem under study. They do not bring individuals into a\n\nlab (a contrived situation), nor do they typically send out instruments for individuals to complete. This up close information gathered by actually talking directly to people and seeing them behave and act within their context is a major characteristic of qualitative research. In the natural setting, the researchers have face-to-face interaction over time.\n• Researcher as key instrument—Qualitative researchers collect data themselves through examining documents, observing behavior, or interviewing participants. They may use a protocol—an instrument for collecting data—but the researchers are the ones who actually gather the information. They do not tend to use or rely on questionnaires or instruments developed by other researchers.\n• Multiple sources of data—Qualitative researchers typically gather multiple forms of data, such as interviews, observations, and documents, rather than rely on a single data source. Then the researchers review all of the data, make sense of it, and organize it into categories or themes that cut across all of the data sources.\n• Inductive data analysis—Qualitative researchers build their patterns, categories, and themes from the bottom up, by organizing the data into increasingly more abstract units of information. This inductive process illustrates working back and forth between the themes and the database until the researchers have established a comprehensive set of themes. It may also involve collaborating with the participants interactively, so that participants have a chance to shape the themes or abstractions that emerge from the process.\n• Participants’ meanings—In the entire qualitative research process, the researcher keeps a focus on learning the meaning that the participants hold about the problem or issue, not the meaning that the researchers bring to the research or writers express in the literature.\n• Emergent design—The research process for qualitative researchers is emergent. This means that the initial plan for research cannot be tightly prescribed, and all phases of the process may change or shift after the researcher enters the field and begins to collect data. For example, the questions may change, the forms of data collection may shift, and the individuals studied and the sites visited may be modified. The key idea behind qualitative research is to learn about the problem or issue from participants and to address the research to obtain that information.\n• Theoretical lens—Qualitative researchers often use lens to view their studies, such as the concept of culture, central to ethnography, or gendered, racial, or class differences from the theoretical orientations discussed in Chapter 3. Sometimes the study may be organized around identifying the social, political, or historical context of the problem under study.\n• Interpretive—Qualitative research is a form of interpretive inquiry in which researchers make an interpretation of what they see, hear, and understand. Their interpretations cannot be separated from their own backgrounds, history, contexts, and prior understandings. After a research report is issued, the readers make an interpretation as well as the participants, offering yet other interpretations of the study. With the readers, the participants, and the researchers all making interpretations, it is apparent how multiple views of the problem can emerge.\n• Holistic account—Qualitative researchers try to develop a complex picture of the problem or issue under study. This involves reporting multiple perspectives, identifying the many factors involved in a situation, and generally sketching the larger picture that emerges. A visual model of many facets of a process or a central phenomenon aid in establishing this holistic picture (see, for example, Creswell & Brown, 1992).\n\nSTRATEGIES OF INQUIRY\nBeyond these general characteristics are more specific strategies of inquiry. These strategies focus on data collection, analysis, and writing, but they originate out of disciplines and flow throughout the process of research (e.g., types of problems, ethical issues of importance; Creswell, 2007b).\nMany strategies exist, such as the 28 approaches identified by Tesch (1990), the 19 types in Wolcott’s (2001) tree, and the 5 approaches to qualitative inquiry by Creswell (2007). As discussed in Chapter 1, I recommend that qualitative researchers choose from among the possibilities, such as narrative, phenomenology, ethnography, case study, and grounded theory. I selected these five because they are popular across the social and health sciences today. Others exist that have been addressed adequately in qualitative books, such as participatory action research (Kemmis & Wilkinson, 1998) or discourse analysis (Cheek, 2004). For the five approaches, researchers might study individuals (narrative, phenomenology); explore processes, activities, and events (case study, grounded theory); or learn about broad culture-sharing behavior of individuals or groups (ethnography).\nIn writing a procedure for a qualitative proposal, consider the following research tips: • Identify the specific approach to inquiry that you will be using.\n• Provide some background information about the strategy, such as its discipline origin, the applications of it, and a brief definition of it (see Chapter 1 for the five strategies of inquiry).\n• Discuss why it is an appropriate strategy to use in the proposed study.\n• Identify how the use of the strategy will shape the types of questions asked (see Morse, 1994, for questions that relate to strategies), the form of data collection, the steps of data analysis, and the final narrative.\nTHE RESEARCHER’S ROLE\nAs mentioned in the list of characteristics, qualitative research is interpretative research, with the inquirer typically involved in a sustained and intensive experience with participants. This introduces a range of strategic, ethical, and personal issues into the qualitative research process (Locke et al., 2007). With these concerns in mind, inquirers explicitly identify reflexively their biases, values, and personal background, such as gender, history, culture, and socioeconomic status, that may shape their interpretations formed during a study. In addition, gaining entry to a research site and the ethical issues that might arise are also elements of the researcher’s role.\n• Include statements about past experiences that provide background data through which the audience can better understand the topic, the setting, or the participants and the researcher’s interpretation of the phenomenon.\n• Comment on connections between the researcher and the participants and on the research sites. “Backyard” research (Glesne & Peshkin, 1992) involves studying the researcher’s own organization, or friends, or immediate work setting. This often leads to compromises in the researcher’s ability to disclose information and raises difficult power issues. Although data collection may be convenient and easy, the problems of reporting data that are biased, incomplete, or compromised are legion. If studying the backyard is necessary, employ multiple\n\nstrategies of validity (as discussed later) to create reader confidence in the accuracy of the findings.\n• Indicate steps taken to obtain permission from the Institutional Review Board (see Chapter 4) to protect the rights of human participants. Attach, as an appendix, the approval letter from the IRB and discuss the process involved in securing permission.\n• Discuss steps taken to gain entry to the setting and to secure permission to study the participants or situation (Marshall & Rossman, 2006). It is important to gain access to research or archival sites by seeking the approval of gatekeepers, individuals at the research site that provide access to the site and allow or permit the research to be done. A brief proposal might need to be developed and submitted for review by gatekeepers. Bogdan and Biklen (1992) advance topics that could be addressed in such a proposal:\n• Why was the site chosen for study?\n• What activities will occur at the site during the research study? • Will the study be disruptive?\n• How will the results be reported?\n• What will the gatekeeper gain from the study?\n• Comment about sensitive ethical issues that may arise (see Chapter 3, and Berg, 2001). For each issue raised, discuss how the research study will address it. For example, when studying a sensitive topic, it is necessary to mask names of people, places, and activities. In this situation, the process for masking information requires discussion in the proposal.\nDATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES\nComments about the role of the researcher set the stage for discussion of issues involved in collecting data. The data collection steps include setting the boundaries for the study, collecting information through unstructured or semistructured observations and interviews, documents, and visual materials, as well as establishing the protocol for recording information.\n• Identify the purposefully selected sites or individuals for the proposed study. The idea behind qualitative research is to purposefully select participants or sites (or documents or visual material) that will best help the researcher understand the problem and the research question. This does not necessarily suggest random sampling or selection of a large number of participants and sites, as typically found in quantitative research. A discussion about participants and site might include four aspects identified by Miles and Huberman (1994): the setting (where the research will take place), the actors (who will be observed or interviewed), the events (what the actors will be observed or interviewed doing), and the process (the evolving nature of events undertaken by the actors within the setting).\n• Indicate the type or types of data to be collected. In many qualitative studies, inquirers collect multiple forms of data and spend a considerable time in the natural setting gathering information. The collection procedures in qualitative research involve four basic types, as shown in Table 9.2.\n\nTable 9.2 Qualitative Data Collection Types, Options, Advantages, and Limitations\n \n • Qualitative observations are those in which the researcher takes field notes on the behavior and activities of individuals at the research site. In these field notes, the researcher records, in an unstructured or semistructured way (using some prior questions that the inquirer wants to know), activities at the research site. Qualitative observers may also engage in roles varying from a non-participant to a complete participant.\n• In qualitative interviews, the researcher conducts face-to-face interviews with participants, interviews participants by telephone, or engages in focus group interviews, with six to eight\n\ninterviewees in each group. These interviews involve unstructured and generally open-ended questions that are few in number and intended to elicit views and opinions from the participants.\n• During the process of research, the investigator may collect qualitative documents. These may be public documents (e.g., newspapers, minutes of meetings, official reports) or private documents (e.g., personal journals and diaries, letters, e-mails).\n• A final category of qualitative data consists of qualitative audio and visual materials. This data may take the form of photographs, art objects, videotapes, or any forms of sound.\n• In a discussion about data collection forms, be specific about the types and include arguments concerning the strengths and weaknesses of each type, as discussed in Table 9.2.\n• Include data collection types that go beyond typical observations and interviews. These unusual forms create reader interest in a proposal and can capture useful information that observations and interviews may miss. For example, examine the compendium of types of data in Table 9.3 that can be used, to stretch the imagination about possibilities, such as gathering sounds or tastes, or using cherished items to elicit comments during an interview.\nDATA RECORDING PROCEDURES\nBefore entering the field, qualitative researchers plan their approach to data recording. The proposal should identify what data the researcher will record and the procedures for recording data.\n• Use a protocol for recording observational data. Researchers often engage in multiple observations during the course of a qualitative study and use an observational protocol for recording information while observing. This may be a single page with a dividing line down the middle to separate descriptive notes (portraits of the participants, a reconstruction of dialogue, a description of the physical setting, accounts of particular events, or activities) from reflective notes (the researcher’s personal thoughts, such as “speculation, feelings, problems, ideas, hunches, impressions, and prejudices” Bogdan & Biklen, 1992, p. 121). Also written on this form might be demographic information about the time, place, and date of the field setting where the observation takes place.\nTable 9.3 A List of Qualitative Data Collection Approaches SOURCE: Adapted from Creswell (2007).\n\n • Use an interview protocol for asking questions and recording answers during a qualitative interview. This protocol includes the following components:\n• A heading (date, place, interviewer, interviewee)\n• Instructions for the interviewer to follow so that standard procedures are used from one interview to another\n• The questions (typically an ice-breaker question at the beginning followed by 4-5 questions that are often the subquestions in a qualitative research plan, followed by some concluding statement or a question, such as, “Who should I visit with to learn more about my questions?”\n• Probes for the 4-5 questions, to follow up and ask individuals to explain their ideas in more detail or to elaborate on what they have said\n• Space between the questions to record responses\n• A final thank-you statement to acknowledge the time the interviewee spent during the interview (see Creswell, 2007)\n\n• Researchers record information from interviews by making handwritten notes, by audiotaping, or by videotaping. Even if an interview is taped, I recommend that researchers take notes, in the event that recording equipment fails. If audiotaping is used, researchers need to plan in advance for the transcription of the tape.\n• The recording of documents and visual materials can be based on the researcher’s structure for taking notes. Typically, notes reflect information about the document or other material as well as key ideas in the documents. It is helpful to note whether the information represents primary material (i.e., information directly from the people or situation under study) or secondary material (i.e., secondhand accounts of the people or situation written by others). It is also helpful to comment on the reliability and value of the data source.\nDATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION\nDiscussion of the plan for analyzing the data might have several components. The process of data analysis involves making sense out of text and image data. It involves preparing the data for analysis, conducting different analyses, moving deeper and deeper into understanding the data (some qualitative researchers like to think of this as peeling back the layers of an onion), representing the data, and making an interpretation of the larger meaning of the data. Several generic processes might be stated in the proposal that convey a sense of the overall activities of qualitative data analysis, such as the following drawn from my own thoughts (Creswell, 2007) and those of Rossman and Rallis (1998):\n• It is an ongoing process involving continual reflection about the data, asking analytic questions, and writing memos throughout the study. I say that qualitative data analysis is conducted concurrently with gathering data, making interpretations, and writing reports. While interviews are going on, for example, the researcher may be analyzing an interview collected earlier, writing memos that may ultimately be included as a narrative in the final report, and organizing the structure of the final report.\n• Data analysis involves collecting open-ended data, based on asking general questions and developing an analysis from the information supplied by participants.\n• Often we see qualitative data analysis reported in journal articles and books that is a generic form of analysis. In this approach, the researcher collects qualitative data, analyzes it for themes or perspectives, and reports 4-5 themes. I consider this approach to be basic qualitative analysis; today many qualitative researchers go beyond this generic analysis to add a procedure within one of the qualitative strategies of inquiry. For example, grounded theory has systematic steps (Corbin & Strauss, 2007; Strauss & Corbin, 1990, 1998). These involve generating categories of information (open coding), selecting one of the categories and positioning it within a theoretical model (axial coding), and then explicating a story from the interconnection of these categories (selective coding). Case study and ethnographic research involve a detailed description of the setting or individuals, followed by analysis of the data for themes or issues (see Stake, 1995; Wolcott, 1994). Phenomenological research uses the analysis of significant statements, the generation of meaning units, and the development of what Moustakas (1994) calls an essence description. Narrative research employs restorying the participants’ stories using structural devices, such as plot, setting, activities, climax, and denouement (Clandinin & Connelly, 2000). As these examples illustrate, the processes as well as the terms differ from one analytic strategy to another.\n\n• Despite these analytic differences depending on the type of strategy used, qualitative inquirers often use a general procedure and convey in the proposal the steps in data analysis. An ideal situation is to blend the general steps with the specific research strategy steps. An overview of the data analysis process is seen in Figure 9.1. As a research tip, I urge researchers to look at qualitative data analysis as following steps from the specific to the general and as involving multiple levels of analysis.\nFigure 9.1 Data Analysis in Qualitative Research\nThis figure suggests a linear, hierarchical approach building from the bottom to the top, but I see it as more interactive in practice; the various stages are interrelated and not always visited in the order presented. These levels are emphasized in the following steps:\nStep 1.Organize and prepare the data for analysis. This involves transcribing interviews, optically scanning material, typing up field notes, or sorting and arranging the data into different types depending on the sources of information.\nStep 2. Read through all the data. A first step is to obtain a general sense of the information and to reflect on its overall meaning. What general ideas are participants saying? What is the tone\n \nof the ideas? What is the impression of the overall depth, credibility, and use of the information? Sometimes qualitative researchers write notes in margins or start recording general thoughts about the data at this stage.\nStep 3. Begin detailed analysis with a coding process. Coding is the process of organizing the material into chunks or segments of text before bringing meaning to information (Rossman & Rallis, 1998, p. 171). It involves taking text data or pictures gathered during data collection, segmenting sentences (or paragraphs) or images into categories, and labeling those categories with a term, often a term based in the actual language of the participant (called an in vivo term).\nBefore proceeding to Step 4, consider some remarks that will provide detailed guidance for the coding process. Tesch (1990, pp. 142-145) provides a useful analysis of the process in eight steps:\n1. Get a sense of the whole. Read all the transcriptions carefully. Perhaps jot down some ideas as they come to mind.\n2. Pick one document (i.e., one interview)—the most interesting one, the shortest, the one on the top of the pile. Go through it, asking yourself, “What is this about?” Do not think about the substance of the information but its underlying meaning. Write thoughts in the margin.\n3. When you have completed this task for several participants, make a list of all topics. Cluster together similar topics. Form these topics into columns, perhaps arrayed as major topics, unique topics, and leftovers.\n4. Now take this list and go back to your data. Abbreviate the topics as codes and write the codes next to the appropriate segments of the text. Try this preliminary organizing scheme to see if new categories and codes emerge.\n5. Find the most descriptive wording for your topics and turn them into categories. Look for ways of reducing your total list of categories by grouping topics that relate to each other. Perhaps draw lines between your categories to show interrelationships.\n6. Make a final decision on the abbreviation for each category and alphabetize these codes.\n7. Assemble the data material belonging to each category in one place and perform a preliminary analysis.\n8. If necessary, recode your existing data.\nThese eight steps engage a researcher in a systematic process of analyzing textual data. Variations exist in this process. As a research tip, I encourage qualitative researchers to analyze their data for material that can address the following:\n• Codes on topics that readers would expect to find, based on the past literature and common sense\n• Codes that are surprising and that were not anticipated at the beginning of the study\n• Codes that are unusual, and that are, in and of themselves, of conceptual interest to readers (e.g., in Asmussen and Creswell, 1995, we identified retriggering as one of the codes/themes in\n\nthe analysis that suggested a new dimension for us to a gunman incident on campus and that seemed to connect with experiences of others on campus)\n• Codes that address a larger theoretical perspective in the research\nAs an alternative conceptualization, consider the list by Bogdan and Biklen (1992, pp. 166-172) of the types of codes that they look for in a qualitative database:\n• Setting and context codes\n• Perspectives held by subjects\n• Subjects’ ways of thinking about people and objects • Process codes\n• Activity codes\n• Strategy codes\n• Relationship and social structure codes\n• Preassigned coding schemes\nOne further issue about coding is whether the researcher should (a) develop codes only on the basis of the emerging information collected from participants, (b) use predetermined codes and then fit the data to them, or (c) use some combination of predetermined and emerging codes. The traditional approach in the social sciences is to allow the codes to emerge during the data analysis. In the health sciences, a popular approach is to use predetermined codes based on the theory being examined. In this case, the researchers might develop a qualitative codebook, a table or record that contains a list of predetermined codes that researchers use for coding the data. This codebook might be composed with the names of codes in one column, a definition of codes in another column, and then specific instances (e.g., line numbers) in which the code was found in the transcripts. Having such a codebook is invaluable when multiple researchers are coding the data from different transcripts. This codebook can evolve and change during a study based on close analysis of the data, even when the researcher is not starting from an emerging code perspective. For researchers who have a distinct theory they want to test in their projects, I would recommend that a preliminary codebook be developed for coding the data and permit the codebook to develop and change based on the information learned during the data analysis. The use of a codebook is especially helpful for fields in which quantitative research dominates and a more systematic approach to qualitative research is needed.\nReturning to the general coding process, some researchers have found it useful to hand code qualitative transcripts or information, sometimes using color code schemes and to cut and paste text segments onto note cards. This is a laborious and time-consuming approach. Others tend to use qualitative computer software programs to help code, organize, and sort information that will be useful in writing the qualitative study. Several excellent computer software programs are available, and they have similar features: good tutorials and demonstration CDs, ability to incorporate both text and image (e.g., photographs) data, the feature of storing and organizing data, the search capacity of locating all text associated with specific codes, interrelated codes for making queries of the relationship among codes, and the import and export of qualitative data to quantitative programs, such as spreadsheets or data analysis programs.\n\nThe basic idea behind these programs is that using the computer is an efficient means for storing and locating qualitative data. Although the researcher still needs to go through each line of text (as in transcriptions) and assign codes, this process may be faster and more efficient than hand coding. Also, in large databases, the researcher can quickly locate all passages (or text segments) coded the same and determine whether participants are responding to a code idea in similar or different ways. Beyond this, the computer program can facilitate comparing different codes (e.g., How do males and females—the first code of gender—differ in terms of their attitudes to smoking—a second code) These are just a few features of the software programs that make them a logical choice for qualitative data analysis over hand coding. As with any software program, qualitative software programs require time and skill to learn and employ effectively, although books for learning the programs are widely available (e.g., Weitzman & Miles, 1995).\nMost of the programs are available only on the PC platform. The computer software programs that my staff and I use in my research office are these:\n• MAXqda (http://www.maxqda.com/). This is an excellent PC-based program from Germany that helps researchers systematically evaluate and interpret qualitative texts. It has all of the features mentioned earlier.\n• Atlas.ti (http://www.atlasti.com). This is another PC-based program from Germany that enables a researcher to organize text, graphic, audio, and visual data files, along with coding, memos and findings, into a project.\n• QSR NVivo (http://www.qsrinternational.com/) This program, from Australia, features the popular software program N6 (or Nud.ist) and NVivo concept mapping in combination. It is available only for Windows PC.\n• HyperRESEARCH (http://www.researchware.com/). This is a program available for either the MAC or PC. It is an easy-to-use qualitative software package enabling users to code, retrieve, build theories, and conduct analyses of the data.\nStep 4. Use the coding process to generate a description of the setting or people as well as categories or themes for analysis. Description involves a detailed rendering of information about people, places, or events in a setting. Researchers can generate codes for this description. This analysis is useful in designing detailed descriptions for case studies, ethnographies, and narrative research projects. Then use the coding to generate a small number of themes or categories, perhaps five to seven categories for a research study. These themes are the ones that appear as major findings in qualitative studies and are often used to create headings in the findings sections of studies. They should display multiple perspectives from individuals and be supported by diverse quotations and specific evidence.\nBeyond identifying the themes during the coding process, qualitative researchers can do much with themes to build additional layers of complex analysis. For example, researchers interconnect themes into a story line (as in narratives) or develop them into a theoretical model (as in grounded theory). Themes are analyzed for each individual case and across different cases (as in case studies) or shaped into a general description (as in phenomenology). Sophisticated qualitative studies go beyond description and theme identification and into complex theme connections.\n    \nStep 5. Advance how the description and themes will be represented in the qualitative narrative. The most popular approach is to use a narrative passage to convey the findings of the analysis. This might be a discussion that mentions a chronology of events, the detailed discussion of several themes (complete with subthemes, specific illustrations, multiple perspectives from individuals, and quotations) or a discussion with interconnecting themes. Many qualitative researchers also use visuals, figures, or tables as adjuncts to the discussions. They present a process model (as in grounded theory), advance a drawing of the specific research site (as in ethnography), or convey descriptive information about each participant in a table (as in case studies and ethnographies).\nStep 6. A final step in data analysis involves making an interpretation or meaning of the data. Asking, “What were the lessons learned?” captures the essence of this idea (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). These lessons could be the researcher’s personal interpretation, couched in the understanding that the inquirer brings to the study from her or his own culture, history, and experiences. It could also be a meaning derived from a comparison of the findings with information gleaned from the literature or theories. In this way, authors suggest that the findings confirm past information or diverge from it. It can also suggest new questions that need to be asked—questions raised by the data and analysis that the inquirer had not foreseen earlier in the study. One way ethnographers can end a study, says Wolcott (1994), is to ask further questions. The questioning approach is also used in advocacy and participatory approaches to qualitative research. Moreover, when qualitative researchers use a theoretical lens, they can form interpretations that call for action agendas for reform and change. Thus, interpretation in qualitative research can take many forms, be adapted for different types of designs, and be flexible to convey personal, research-based, and action meanings.\nRELIABILITY, VALIDITY, AND GENERALIZABILITY\nAlthough validation of findings occurs throughout the steps in the process of research (as shown in Figure 9.1), this discussion focuses on it to enable a researcher to write a passage into a proposal on the procedures for validating the findings that will be undertaken in a study. Proposal developers need to convey the steps they will take in their studies to check for the accuracy and credibility of their findings.\nValidity does not carry the same connotations in qualitative research as it does in quantitative research, nor is it a companion of reliability (examining stability or consistency of responses) or generalizability (the external validity of applying results to new settings, people, or samples; both are discussed in Chapter 8). Qualitative validity means that the researcher checks for the accuracy of the findings by employing certain procedures, while qualitative reliability indicates that the researcher’s approach is consistent across different researchers and different projects (Gibbs, 2007).\nHow do qualitative researchers check to determine if their approaches are consistent or reliable? Yin (2003) suggests that qualitative researchers need to document the procedures of their case studies and to document as many of the steps of the procedures as possible. He also\n\nrecommends setting up a detailed case study protocol and database. Gibbs (2007) suggests several reliability procedures:\n• Check transcripts to make sure that they do not contain obvious mistakes made during transcription.\n• Make sure that there is not a drift in the definition of codes, a shift in the meaning of the codes during the process of coding. This can be accomplished by constantly comparing data with the codes and by writing memos about the codes and their definitions (see the discussion on a qualitative codebook).\n• For team research, coordinate the communication among the coders by regular documented meetings and by sharing the analysis.\n• Cross-check codes developed by different researchers by comparing results that are independently derived.\nProposal writers need to include several of these procedures as evidence that they will have consistent results in their proposed study. I recommend that several procedures be mentioned in a proposal and that single researchers find another person who can cross-check their codes, for what I call intercoder agreement (or cross-checking). Such an agreement might be based on whether two or more coders agree on codes used for the same passages in the text (it is not that they code the same passage of text, but whether another coder would code it with the same or a similar code). Statistical procedures or reliability subprograms in qualitative computer software packages can then be used to determine the level of consistency of coding. Miles and Huberman (1994) recommend that the consistency of the coding be in agreement at least 80% of the time for good qualitative reliability.\nValidity, on the other hand, is one of the strengths of qualitative research, and it is based on determining whether the findings are accurate from the standpoint of the researcher, the participant, or the readers of an account (Creswell & Miller, 2000). Terms abound in the qualitative literature that speak to this idea, such as trustworthiness, authenticity, and credibility (Creswell & Miller, 2000), and it is a much-discussed topic (Lincoln & Guba, 2000).\nA procedural perspective that I recommend for research proposals is to identify and discuss one or more strategies available to check the accuracy of the findings. The researcher actively incorporates validity strategies into their proposal. I recommend the use of multiple strategies, and these should enhance the researcher’s ability to assess the accuracy of findings as well as convince readers of that accuracy. There are eight primary strategies, organized from those most frequently used and easy to implement to those occasionally used and more difficult to implement:\n• Triangulate different data sources of information by examining evidence from the sources and using it to build a coherent justification for themes. If themes are established based on converging several sources of data or perspectives from participants, then this process can be claimed as adding to the validity of the study.\n• Use member checking to determine the accuracy of the qualitative findings through taking the final report or specific descriptions or themes back to participants and determining whether these participants feel that they are accurate. This does not mean taking back the raw transcripts to check for accuracy; instead, the researcher takes back parts of the polished product, such as the themes, the case analysis, the grounded theory, the cultural description,\n\nand so forth. This procedure can involve conducting a follow-up interview with participants in the study and providing an opportunity for them to comment on the findings.\n• Use rich, thick description to convey the findings. This description may transport readers to the setting and give the discussion an element of shared experiences. When qualitative researchers provide detailed descriptions of the setting, for example, or provide many perspectives about a theme, the results become more realistic and richer. This procedure can add to the validity of the findings.\n• Clarify the bias the researcher brings to the study. This self-reflection creates an open and honest narrative that will resonate well with readers. Reflectivity has been mentioned as a core characteristic of qualitative research. Good qualitative research contains comments by the researchers about how their interpretation of the findings is shaped by their background, such as their gender, culture, history, and socioeconomic origin.\n• Also present negative or discrepant information that runs counter to the themes. Because real life is composed of different perspectives that do not always coalesce, discussing contrary information adds to the credibility of an account. A researcher can accomplish this in discussing evidence about a theme. Most evidence will build a case for the theme; researchers can also present information that contradicts the general perspective of the theme. By presenting this contradictory evidence, the account becomes more realistic and hence valid.\n• Spend prolonged time in the field. In this way, the researcher develops an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon under study and can convey detail about the site and the people that lends credibility to the narrative account. The more experience that a researcher has with participants in their actual setting, the more accurate or valid will be the findings.\n• Use peer debriefing to enhance the accuracy of the account. This process involves locating a person (a peer debriefer) who reviews and asks questions about the qualitative study so that the account will resonate with people other than the researcher. This strategy—involving an interpretation beyond the researcher and invested in another person—adds validity to an account.\n• Use an external auditor to review the entire project. As distinct from a peer debriefer, this auditor is not familiar with the researcher or the project and can provide an objective assessment of the project throughout the process of research or at the conclusion of the study. The role is similar to that of a fiscal auditor, and specific questions exist that auditors might ask (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). The procedure of having an independent investigator look over many aspects of the project (e.g., accuracy of transcription, the relationship between the research questions and the data, the level of data analysis from the raw data through interpretation) enhances the overall validity of a qualitative study.\nQualitative generalization is a term that is used in a limited way in qualitative research, since the intent of this form of inquiry is not to generalize findings to individuals, sites, or places outside of those under study (see Gibbs, 2007, for his cautionary note about qualitative generalizability). In fact, the value of qualitative research lies in the particular description and themes developed in context of a specific site. Particularity rather than generalizability (Greene & Caracelli, 1997) is the hallmark of qualitative research. However, there are a few discussions in the qualitative literature about generalizability, especially as applied to case study research in which the inquirer studies several cases. Yin (2003), for example, feels that qualitative case study results can be generalized to some broader theory. The generalization occurs when\n\nqualitative researchers study additional cases and generalize findings to the new cases. It is the same as the replication logic used in experimental research. However, to repeat a case study’s findings in a new case setting requires good documentation of qualitative procedures, such as a protocol for documenting the problem in detail and the development of a thorough case study database (Yin, 2003).\nTHE QUALITATIVE WRITE-UP\nA plan for a qualitative procedure should end with some comments about the narrative that emerges from the data analysis. Numerous varieties of narratives exist, and examples from scholarly journals illustrate models. In a plan for a study, consider advancing several points about the narrative.\nThe basic procedure in reporting the results of a qualitative study are to develop descriptions and themes from the data (see Figure 9.1), to present these descriptions and themes that convey multiple perspectives from participants and detailed descriptions of the setting or individuals. Using a qualitative strategy of inquiry, these results may also provide a chronological narrative of an individual’s life (narrative research), a detailed description of their experiences (phenomenology), a theory generated from the data (grounded theory), a detailed portrait of a culture-sharing group (ethnography), or an in-depth analysis of one or more cases (case study).\nGiven these different strategies, the findings and interpretation sections of a plan for a study might discuss how the sections will be presented: as objective accounts, fieldwork experiences (Van Maanen, 1988), a chronology, a process model, an extended story, an analysis by cases or across cases, or a detailed descriptive portrait (Creswell, 2007).\nAt the specific level, some writing strategies might be as follows:\n• Use quotes and vary their length from short to long embedded passages.\n• Script conversation and report the conversation in different languages to reflect cultural sensitivity.\n• Present text information in tabular form (e.g., matrices, comparison tables of different codes).\n• Use the wording from participants to form codes and theme labels.\n• Intertwine quotations with (the author’s) interpretations.\n• Use indents or other special formatting of the manuscript to call attention to quotations from participants.\n• Use the first person “I” or collective “we” in the narrative form.\n• Use metaphors and analogies (see, for example, Richardson, 1990, who discusses some of these forms).\n• Use the narrative approach typically used within a qualitative strategy of inquiry (e.g., description in case studies and ethnographies, a detailed story in narrative research).\n• Describe how the narrative outcome will be compared with theories and the general literature on the topic. In many qualitative articles, researchers discuss the literature at the end of the study (see the discussion in Chapter 2).",

  "Qualitative and Quantitative": "Mixed methods research is an approach to inquiry that combines or associates both qualitative and quantitative forms. It involves philosophical assumptions, the use of qualitative and quantitative approaches, and the mixing of both approaches in a study. Thus, it is more than simply collecting and analyzing both kinds of data; it also involves the use of both approaches in tandem so that the overall strength of a study is greater than either qualitative or quantitative research (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007). Mixed methods strategies are less well known than either the quantitative or qualitative approaches. The concept of mixing different methods originated in 1959 when Campbell and Fisk used multimethods to study validity of psychological traits. They encouraged others to employ their multimethod matrix to examine multiple approaches to data collection. This prompted others to mix methods, and soon approaches associated with field methods, such as observations and interviews (qualitative data), were combined with traditional surveys (quantitative data; Sieber, 1973). Recognizing that all methods have limitations, researchers felt that biases inherent in any single method could neutralize or cancel the biases of other methods. Triangulating data sources—a means for seeking convergence across qualitative and\nquantitative methods—was born (Jick, 1979). By the early 1990s, the idea of mixing moved from seeking convergence to actually integrating or connecting the quantitative and qualitative data. For example, the results from one method can help identify participants to study or questions to ask for the other method (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). Alternatively, the qualitative and quantitative data can be merged into one large database or the results used side by side to reinforce each other (e.g., qualitative quotes support statistical results; Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007). Or the methods can serve a larger, transformative purpose to advocate for marginalized groups, such as women, ethnic/racial minorities, members of gay and lesbian communities, people with disabilities, and those who are poor (Mertens, 2003).\nThese reasons for mixing methods have led writers from around the world to develop procedures for mixed methods strategies of inquiry, and these take the numerous terms found in the literature, such as multimethod, convergence, integrated, and combined (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007), and shape procedures for research (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003).\nIn particular, three general strategies and several variations within them are illustrated in this book:\n• Sequential mixed methods procedures are those in which the researcher seeks to elaborate on or expand on the findings of one method with another method. This may involve beginning with a qualitative interview for exploratory purposes and following up with a quantitative, survey method with a large sample so that the researcher can generalize results to a population. Alternatively, the study may begin with a quantitative method in which a theory or concept is tested, followed by a qualitative method involving detailed exploration with a few cases or individuals.\n• Concurrent mixed methods procedures are those in which the researcher converges or merges quantitative and qualitative data in order to provide a comprehensive analysis of the research problem. In this design, the investigator collects both forms of data at the same time and then integrates the information in the interpretation of the overall results. Also, in this design, the researcher may embed one smaller form of data within another larger data collection in order to analyze different types of questions (the qualitative addresses the process while the quantitative, the outcomes).\n• Transformative mixed methods procedures are those in which the researcher uses a theoretical lens (see Chapter 3) as an overarching perspective within a design that contains both quantitative and qualitative data. This lens provides a framework for topics of interest, methods for collecting data, and outcomes or changes anticipated by the study. Within this lens could be a data collection method that involves a sequential or a concurrent approach. Mixed methods approach—Pragmatic worldview, collection of both quantitative and qualitative data sequentially\nThe researcher bases the inquiry on the assumption that collecting diverse types of data best provides an understanding of a research problem. The study begins with a broad survey in order to generalize results to a population and then, in a second phase, focuses on qualitative, open-ended interviews to collect detailed views from participants. Mixed methods researchers use theory either deductively (as in quantitative research) or inductively (as in qualitative research). Writers also are beginning to identify the use of theoretical lenses or perspectives (e.g., related to gender, lifestyle, race/ethnicity, and class) in their mixed methods studies. A transformational-emancipatory design incorporates this perspective, and recent developments have identified procedures for incorporating this perspective into all phases of the research process. Mixed methods research has evolved a set of procedures that proposal developers can use in planning a mixed methods study. In 2003, the Handbook of Mixed Methods in the Social & Behavior Sciences (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003) was published, providing the first comprehensive overview of this strategy of inquiry. Now several journals emphasize mixed methods research, such as the Journal of Mixed Methods Research, Quality and Quantity, and Field Methods, while numerous others actively encourage this form of inquiry (e.g., International Journal of Social Research Methodology, Qualitative Health Research, Annals of Family Medicine). Numerous published research studies have incorporated mixed methods research in the social and human sciences in diverse fields such as occupational therapy (Lysack & Krefting, 1994), interpersonal communication (Boneva, Kraut, & Frohlich, 2001), AIDS prevention (Janz et al., 1996), dementia caregiving (Weitzman & Levkoff, 2000), mental health (Rogers, Day, Randall, & Bentall, 2003), and in middle-school science (Houtz, 1995). New books arrive each year solely devoted to mixed methods research (Bryman, 2006; Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Greene, 2007; Plano Clark & Creswell, 2008; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998).\nA checklist of questions for designing a mixed methods study appears in Table 10.1. These components call for advancing the nature of mixed methods research and the type of strategy being proposed for the study. They also include the need for a visual model of this approach, the specific procedures of data collection and analysis, the researcher’s role, and the structure for presenting the final report. Following the discussion of each of these components, an\nexample of a procedures section from a mixed methods study is presented to show how to apply these ideas.\nTHE NATURE OF MIXED METHODS RESEARCH\nBecause mixed methods research is relatively new in the social and human sciences as a distinct research approach, it is useful to convey a basic definition and description of the approach in a proposal. This might include the following:\n• Trace a brief history of its evolution. Several sources identify its inception in psychology and in the multitrait-multimethod matrix of Campbell and Fiske (1959) to interest in converging or triangulating different quantitative and qualitative data sources (Jick, 1979) and on to the development of a distinct methodology of inquiry (see Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998).\n• Define mixed methods research by incorporating the definition in Chapter 1 that focuses on combining both quantitative and qualitative research and methods in a research study (see a more expanded view of defining mixed methods research in Johnson, Onwuegbuzie, & Turner, 2007). Highlight the reasons why researchers employ a mixed methods design (e.g., to broaden understanding by incorporating both qualitative and quantitative research, or to use one approach to better understand, explain, or build on the results from the other approach). Also note that the mixing of the two might be within one study or among several studies in a program of inquiry. Recognize that many different terms are used for this approach, such as integrating, synthesis, quantitative and qualitative methods, multimethod, and mixed methodology, but that recent writings use the term mixed methods (Bryman, 2006; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003).\nTable 10.1 A Checklist of Questions for Designing a Mixed Methods Procedure\n\n • Briefly discuss the growth of interest in mixed methods research as expressed in books, journal articles, diverse disciplines, and funded projects (see Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007 for a discussion about the many initiatives that contribute to mixed methods today).\n• Note the challenges this form of research poses for the inquirer. These include the need for extensive data collection, the time-intensive nature of analyzing both text and numeric data, and the requirement for the researcher to be familiar with both quantitative and qualitative forms of research.\nTYPES OF MIXED METHODS STRATEGIES AND VISUAL MODELS\nThere have been several typologies for classifying and identifying types of mixed methods strategies that proposal developers might use in their proposed mixed methods study. Creswell and Plano Clark (2007) identify 12 classification systems drawn from the fields of evaluation, nursing, public health, education policy and research, and social and behavioral research. In these classifications, authors use diverse terms for their types of designs, and a substantial amount of overlap exists in the typologies. For purposes of this discussion I will identify and discuss the six types that my colleagues and I advanced in 2003 (Creswell et al., 2003).\nPlanning Mixed Methods Procedures\nIt is helpful, however, before discussing the six types, to consider several aspects that influence the design of procedures for a mixed methods study. Four important aspects are timing, weighting, mixing, and theorizing (as shown in Figure 10.1).\nTiming\nProposal developers need to consider the timing of their qualitative and quantitative data collection, whether it will be in phases (sequentially) or gathered at the same time\n\n(concurrently). When the data are collected in phases, either the qualitative or the quantitative data can come first. It depends on the initial intent of the researcher. When qualitative data are collected first, the intent is to explore the topic with participants at sites. Then the researcher expands the understanding through a second phase in which data are collected from a large number of people (typically a sample representative of a population). When data are collected concurrently, both quantitative and qualitative data are gathered at the same time and the implementation is simultaneous. In many projects it may be unworkable to collect data over an expanded time period (e.g., in the health sciences when busy medical personnel have limited time for data collection in the field). In this case, it is more manageable to collect both quantitative and qualitative data at roughly the same time, when the researcher(s) is in the field collecting data, rather than to revisit the field multiple times for data collection.\nWeighting\nA second factor that goes into designing procedures is the weight or priority given to quantitative or qualitative research in a particular study. In some studies, the weight might be equal; in other studies, it might emphasize one or the other. A priority for one type depends on the interests of the researcher, the audience for the study (e.g., faculty committee, professional association), and what the investigator seeks to emphasize in the study. In practical terms, weight occurs in a mixed methods study through such strategies as whether quantitative or qualitative information is emphasized first, the extent of treatment of one type of data or the other in the project, or the use of primarily an inductive approach (i.e., generating themes in qualitative) or a deductive approach (i.e., testing a theory). Sometimes the researcher intentionally uses one form of data in a supportive role to a larger study, as is found in some experimental trials (see Rogers et al., 2003).\nFigure 10.1 Aspects to Consider in Planning a Mixed Methods Design SOURCE: Adapted from Creswell et al. (2003).\nMixing\nMixing the data (and in a larger sense, mixing the research questions, philosophy, the interpretation) is difficult at best when one considers that qualitative data consists of text and images and quantitative data, numbers. There are two different questions here: When does a\n \nresearcher mix in a mixed methods study? And how does mixing occur? The first question is much easier to answer than the second. Mixing of the two types of data might occur at several stages: the data collection, the data analysis, interpretation, or at all three phases. For proposal developers using mixed methods, it is important to discuss and present in a proposal when the mixing will occur.\nHow the data are mixed has received considerable recent attention (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007). Mixing means either that the qualitative and quantitative data are actually merged on one end of the continuum, kept separate on the other end of the continuum, or combined in some way between these two extremes. The two data bases might be kept separate but connected; for example, in a two-phase project that begins with a quantitative phase, the analysis of the data and its results can be used to identify participants for qualitative data collection in a follow-up phase. In this situation, the quantitative and qualitative data are connected during the phases of research. Connected in mixed methods research means a mixing of the quantitative and qualitative research are connected between a data analysis of the first phase of research and the data collection of the second phase of research. In another study, the researcher might collect both quantitative and qualitative data concurrently and integrate or merge the two databases by transforming the qualitative themes into counts and comparing these counts with descriptive quantitative data. In this case, the mixing consists of integrating the two databases by actually merging the quantitative data with the qualitative data. In a final scenario, the researcher might have a primary aim to collect one form of data (say quantitative) and have the other form of data (say qualitative) provide supportive information. Neither integrating the data nor connecting across phases is being utilized. Instead, the researcher is embedding a secondary form of data within a larger study having a different form of data as the primary database. The secondary database provides a supporting role in the study.\nTheorizing or Transforming Perspectives\nA final factor to consider is whether a larger, theoretical perspective guides the entire design. It may be a theory from the social sciences (e.g., adoption theory, leadership theory, attribution theory) or a broad theoretical lens, such as an advocacy/participatory lens (e.g., gender, race, class; see Chapter 3). All researchers bring theories, frameworks and hunches to their inquiries, and these theories may be made explicit in a mixed methods study or be implicit and not mentioned. We will focus here on the use of explicit theories. In mixed methods studies, the theories are found typically in the beginning sections as an orienting lens that shapes the types of questions asked, who participates in the study, how data are collected, and the implications made from the study (typically for change and advocacy). They present an overarching perspective used with all of the mixed methods strategies of inquiry (to be presently discussed). Mertens (2003) provides a good discussion as to how a transforming lens shapes all phases of the research process in mixed methods research.\nAlternative Strategies and Visual Models\nThese four factors—timing, weight, mixing, and theorizing—help to shape the procedures of a mixed methods study. Although these do not exhaust all the possibilities, there are six major strategies for inquirers to choose from in designing a research proposal; they are adapted from Creswell et al. (2003). A proposal would contain a description of the strategy and a visual model of it, as well as basic procedures that the investigator will use in implementing the strategy. Each strategy is briefly described and illustrated in Figures 10.2 and 10.3. The words qualitative\n\nand quantitative have been shortened in the figures to read “qual” and “quan,” respectively (see the discussion following the figures).\nThese mixed methods strategies can be described using notation that has developed in the mixed methods field. Mixed methods notation provides shorthand labels and symbols that convey important aspects of mixed methods research, and it provides a way that mixed methods researchers can easily communicate their procedures. The following notation is adapted from Morse (1991), Tashakkori and Teddlie (1998), and Creswell and Plano Clark (2007) who suggest the following:\n• A “+” indicates a simultaneous or concurrent form of data collection, with both quantitative and qualitative data collected at same time.\n•A“\nbuilding on the other (e.g., quantitative data).\nFigure 10.2 Sequential Designs\nSOURCE: Adapted from Creswell et al. (2003).\nFigure 10.3 Concurrent Designs\nSOURCE: Adapted from Creswell et al. (2003).\n  \n • Capitalization indicates a weight or priority on the quantitative or qualitative data, analysis, and interpretation in the study. In a mixed methods study, the qualitative and quantitative data may be equally emphasized, or one may be more emphasized than the other. Capitalization indicates that an approach or method is emphasized.\n• “Quan” and “Qual” stand for quantitative and qualitative, respectively, and they use the same number of letters to indicate equality between the forms of data.\n• A QUAN/qual notation indicates that the qualitative methods are embedded within a quantitative design.\n• Boxes highlight the quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis.\nIn addition, incorporated into each figure are specific data collection, analysis, and interpretation procedures to help the reader understand the more specific procedures used. In this way, a figure has at least two elements: the general procedure of mixed methods being used and the more specific procedures of data collection, analysis, and interpretation.\nSequential Explanatory Strategy\nThe sequential explanatory strategy is a popular strategy for mixed methods design that often appeals to researchers with strong quantitative leanings. It is characterized by the collection and analysis of quantitative data in a first phase of research followed by the collection and analysis of qualitative data in a second phase that builds on the results of the initial quantitative results. Weight typically is given to the quantitative data, and the mixing of the data occurs when the initial quantitative results informs the secondary qualitative data collection. Thus, the two forms of data are separate but connected. An explicit theory may or may not inform the overall procedure. The steps of this strategy are pictured in Figure 10.2a.\nA sequential explanatory design is typically used to explain and interpret quantitative results by collecting and analyzing follow-up qualitative data. It can be especially useful when unexpected\n\nresults arise from a quantitative study (Morse, 1991). In this case, the qualitative data collection that follows can be used to examine these surprising results in more detail. This strategy may or may not have a specific theoretical perspective. The straightforward nature of this design is one of its main strengths. It is easy to implement because the steps fall into clear, separate stages. In addition, this design feature makes it easy to describe and to report. The main weakness of this design is the length of time involved in data collection, with the two separate phases. This is especially a drawback if the two phases are given equal priority.\nSequential Exploratory Strategy\nThis next strategy is similar to the explanatory sequential approach except that the phases are reversed. The sequential exploratory strategy involves a first phase of qualitative data collection and analysis, followed by a second phase of quantitative data collection and analysis that builds on the results of the first qualitative phase. Weight is generally placed on the first phase, and the data are mixed through being connected between the qualitative data analysis and the quantitative data collection. The design may or may not be implemented within an explicit theoretical perspective (see Figure 10.2b).\nAt the most basic level, the purpose of this strategy is to use quantitative data and results to assist in the interpretation of qualitative findings. Unlike the sequential explanatory approach, which is better suited to explaining and interpreting relationships, the primary focus of this model is to initially explore a phenomenon. Morgan (1998) suggested that this design is appropriate to use when testing elements of an emergent theory resulting from the qualitative phase and that it can also be used to generalize qualitative findings to different samples. Similarly, Morse (1991) cited one purpose for selecting this approach: to determine the distribution of a phenomenon within a chosen population. Finally, the sequential exploratory strategy is often discussed as the procedure of choice when a researcher needs to develop an instrument because existing instruments are inadequate or not available. Using a three-phase approach, the researcher first gathers qualitative data and analyzes it (Phase 1), and uses the analysis to development an instrument (Phase 2) that is subsequently administered to a sample of a population (Phase 3; Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007).\nThe sequential exploratory strategy has many of the same advantages as the sequential explanatory model. Its two-phase approach (qualitative research followed by quantitative research) makes it easy to implement and straightforward to describe and report. It is useful to a researcher who wants to explore a phenomenon but also wants to expand on the qualitative findings. This model is especially advantageous when a researcher is building a new instrument. In addition, this model could make a largely qualitative study more palatable to an adviser, committee, or research community well versed in quantitative research and that may be unfamiliar with the qualitative approaches. As with the sequential explanatory approach, the sequential exploratory model requires a substantial length of time to complete both data collection phases, which can be a drawback for some research situations. In addition, the researcher has to make some key decisions about which findings from the initial qualitative phase will be focused on in the subsequent quantitative phase (e.g., one theme, comparisons among groups, multiple themes).\nSequential Transformative Strategy\nThis final sequential approach has two distinct data collection phases, one following the other as in the first two strategies described (see Figure 10.2c). The sequential transformative strategy is a two-phase project with a theoretical lens (e.g., gender, race, social science theory)\n\noverlaying the sequential procedures. It too has an initial phase (either quantitative or qualitative) followed by a second phase (either qualitative or quantitative) that builds on the earlier phase. The theoretical lens is introduced in the introduction to a proposal, shapes a directional research question aimed at exploring a problem (e.g., inequality, discrimination, injustice), creates sensitivity to collecting data from marginalized or underrepresented groups, and ends with a call for action. In this design the researcher may use either method in the first phase of research, and the weight can be given to either or distributed evenly to both phases. The mixing is connected as in all sequential designs. Unlike the sequential exploratory and explanatory approaches, the sequential transformative model has a theoretical perspective to guide the study. The aim of this theoretical perspective, whether it be a conceptual framework, a specific ideology, or advocacy, is more important in guiding the study than the use of methods alone.\nThe purpose of a sequential transformative strategy is to best serve the theoretical perspective of the researcher. By using two phases, a sequential transformative researcher may be able to give voice to diverse perspectives, to better advocate for participants, or to better understand a phenomenon or process that is changing as a result of being studied.\nThe sequential transformative model shares the methodological strengths and weaknesses of the other two sequential approaches. Its use of distinct phases facilitates its implementation, description, and sharing of results, although it also requires the time to complete two data collection phases. More important, this design places mixed methods research within a transformative framework. Therefore, this strategy may be more appealing and acceptable to those researchers already using a transformative framework within one distinct methodology, such as qualitative research. Unfortunately, because little has been written to date on this approach, one weakness is that there is little guidance on how to use the transformative vision to guide the methods. Likewise, as with all sequential strategies, key decisions need to be made about what findings in the first phase will be the focus of the second phase.\nConcurrent Triangulation Strategy\nThe concurrent triangulation approach is probably the most familiar of the six major mixed methods models (see Figure 10.3a). In a concurrent triangulation approach, the researcher collects both quantitative and qualitative data concurrently and then compares the two databases to determine if there is convergence, differences, or some combination. Some authors refer to this comparison as confirmation, disconfirmation, cross-validation, or corroboration (Greene, Caracelli, & Graham, 1989; Morgan, 1998; Steckler, McLeroy, Goodman, Bird, & McCormick, 1992). This model generally uses separate quantitative and qualitative methods as a means to offset the weaknesses inherent within one method with the strengths of the other (or conversely, the strength of one adds to the strength of the other). In this approach, the quantitative and qualitative data collection is concurrent, happening in one phase of the research study. Ideally, the weight is equal between the two methods, but often in practice, priority may be given to one or the other. The mixing during this approach, usually found in an interpretation or discussion section, is to actually merge the data (i.e., transform one type of data to the other type of data so that they can easily be compared) or integrate or compare the results of two databases side by side in a discussion. This side-by-side integration is often seen in published mixed methods studies in which a discussion section first provides quantitative statistical results followed by qualitative quotes that support or disconfirm the quantitative results.\n\nThis traditional mixed methods model is advantageous because it is familiar to most researchers and can result in well-validated and substantiated findings. I find that most researchers when they first consider mixed methods employ this model of gathering both quantitative and qualitative data and comparing the two data sources. In addition, the concurrent data collection results in a shorter data collection time period as compared to one of the sequential approaches because both the qualitative and quantitative data are gathered at one time at the research site.\nThis model also has a number of limitations. It requires great effort and expertise to adequately study a phenomenon with two separate methods. It also can be difficult to compare the results of two analyses using data of different forms. In addition, a researcher may be unclear how to resolve discrepancies that arise in comparing the results, although procedures are emerging in the literature, such as conducting additional data collection to resolve the discrepancy, revisiting the original database, gaining new insight from the disparity of the data, or developing a new project that addresses the discrepancy (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007).\nConcurrent Embedded Strategy\nLike the concurrent triangulation approach, the concurrent embedded strategy of mixed methods can be identified by its use of one data collection phase, during which both quantitative and qualitative data are collected simultaneously (see Figure 10.3b). Unlike the traditional triangulation model, a concurrent embedded approach has a primary method that guides the project and a secondary database that provides a supporting role in the procedures. Given less priority, the secondary method (quantitative or qualitative) is embedded, or nested, within the predominant method (qualitative or quantitative). This embedding may mean that the secondary method addresses a different question than the primary method (e.g., in an experiment, the quantitative data addresses the outcomes expected from the treatments while the qualitative data explores the processes experienced by individuals in the treatment groups) or seeks information at a different level of analysis (the analogy to hierarchical analysis in quantitative research is helpful in conceptualizing these levels—see Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998). The mixing of the data from the two methods is often to integrate the information and compare one data source with the other, typically accomplished in a discussion section of a study. However, the data may also not be compared but reside side by side as two different pictures that provide an overall composite assessment of the problem. This would be the case when the researcher uses this approach to assess different research questions or different levels in an organization. Similar to the other approaches, an explicit theoretical perspective can be used in this model, typically to inform the primary method.\nThe concurrent embedded model may be used to serve a variety of purposes. Often, this model is used so that a researcher can gain broader perspectives as a result of using the different methods as opposed to using the predominant method alone. For example, Morse (1991) noted that a primarily qualitative design could embed some quantitative data to enrich the description of the sample participants. Likewise, she described how qualitative data could be used to describe an aspect of a quantitative study that cannot be quantified. In addition, a concurrent embedded model may be employed when a researcher chooses to utilize different methods to study different groups or levels. For example, if an organization is being studied, employees could be studied quantitatively, managers could be interviewed qualitatively, entire divisions could be analyzed with quantitative data, and so forth. Tashakkori and Teddlie (1998) described this approach as a multilevel design. Finally, one method could be used within a framework of the other method, such as if a researcher designed and conducted an experiment\n\nto examine treatment outcomes but used case study methodology to study how participants in the study experienced the treatment procedures.\nThis mixed methods model is attractive for several reasons. A researcher is able to collect the two types of data simultaneously, during a single data collection phase. It provides a study with the advantages of both quantitative and qualitative data. In addition, by using the two different methods in this fashion, a researcher can gain perspectives from the different types of data or from different levels within the study.\nThere are also limitations to consider when choosing this approach. The data need to be transformed in some way so that they can be integrated within the analysis phase of the research. In addition, if the two databases are compared, discrepancies may occur that need to be resolved. Because the two methods are unequal in their priority, this approach also results in unequal evidence within a study, which may be a disadvantage when interpreting the final results.\nConcurrent Transformative Strategy\nAs with the sequential transformative model, the concurrent transformative approach is guided by the researcher’s use of a specific theoretical perspective as well as the concurrent collection of both quantitative and qualitative data (see Figure 10.3c). This perspective can be based on ideologies such as critical theory, advocacy, participatory research, or a conceptual or theoretical framework. This perspective is reflected in the purpose or research questions of the study. It is the driving force behind all methodological choices, such as defining the problem, identifying the design and data sources, analyzing, interpreting, and reporting results. The choice of a concurrent model, whether it is triangulation or embedded design, is made to facilitate this perspective. For example, the design may have one method embedded in the other so that diverse participants are given a voice in the change process of an organization. It may involve a triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data to best converge information to provide evidence for an inequality of policies in an organization.\nThus, the concurrent transformative model may take on the design features of either a triangulation or an embedded approach (the two types of data are collected at the same time during one data collection phase and may have equal or unequal priority). The mixing of the data would be through merging, connecting, or embedding the data. Because the concurrent transformative model shares features with the triangulation and embedded approaches, it also shares their specific strengths and weaknesses. However, this model has the added advantage of positioning mixed methods research within a transformative framework, which may make it especially appealing to those qualitative or quantitative researchers already using a transformative framework to guide their inquiry.\nChoosing a Mixed Methods Strategy\nProposal developers need to convey the specific strategy for mixed methods data collection they plan to use. Further, they need to advance a visual figure that presents the procedures they plan to use. Figures 10.2 and 10.3 provide some useful models for guidance. Here are some research tips about how to select a mixed methods strategy:\n• Use the information in Figure 10.1 to assess the aspects that you will be working with in your mixed methods procedures, and then identify one of the six approaches discussed in this chapter as the primary design for your proposed study. Provide a working definition for this design, along with a visual model and a rationale as to why it is a useful design for you to us.\n\n• Consider the amount of time you have to collect data. Concurrent approaches are less time consuming because both qualitative and quantitative data are collected at the same time in the same visit to the field.\n• Remember that the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data is a rigorous, time-consuming process. When time is a problem, I encourage students to think about an embedded model of design. This model emphasizes a major primary form of data collection (e.g., surveys), and it can include a minor secondary form of data collection (e.g., a few interviews with some of the participants who completed the surveys). The fact that both forms of data are not equal in size and rigor enables the study to be reduced in scope and manageable for the time and resources available.\n• Consider using the explanatory sequential approach. It is a favorite of many students, especially those who have little experience with qualitative research and substantial background in quantitative research. In this approach, an initial quantitative data collection is followed by a secondary qualitative data collection to follow up the quantitative results.\n• Study published articles that use different approaches and determine which one makes the most sense to you. Creswell and Plano Clark (2007) include four complete journal articles so that readers can examine the detail of studies employing different forms of designs.\n• Find a published mixed methods journal article that uses your design and introduce it to your adviser and faculty committee so that they have a working model for the approach you plan to use in your study. Since we are at the early stage of adopting mixed methods research in many fields, a published example of research in your field will help to create both legitimacy for mixed methods research and the idea that it is a feasible approach to research for graduate committees or other audiences.\nDATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES\nAlthough the visual model and the discussion about the specific strategies in a proposal provide a picture of the procedures, it is helpful to discuss the specific types of data to be collected. It is also important to identify the sampling strategies and the approaches used to establish validity of the data.\n• Identify and be specific about the type of data—both quantitative and qualitative—that will be collected during the proposed study. Refer to Table 1.3, which shows both quantitative and qualitative data. Data differs in terms of open-ended versus closed-ended responses. Some forms of data, such as interviews and observations, can be either quantitative or qualitative depending on how open (qualitative) or closed (quantitative) the response options might be in an interview or a checklist for an observation. Although reducing information to numbers is the approach used in quantitative research, it is also used in qualitative research.\n• Recognize that quantitative data often involve random sampling, so that each individual has an equal probability of being selected, and the sample can be generalized to the larger population. In qualitative data collection, purposeful sampling is used so that individuals are selected because they have experienced the central phenomenon. Rigorous sampling procedures need to be conveyed in a proposal for the quantitative and qualitative data collection. In addition, Teddlie and Yu (2007) have developed a typology of five types of mixed methods sampling which relates sampling to the strategies for mixed methods that I have discussed:\n\n• Basic strategies that involve combining quantitative and qualitative sampling (e.g., stratified purposeful sampling, purposive random sampling)\n• Sequential sampling, in which the sampling from the first phase or strand informs the second phase or strand\n• Concurrent sampling, in which quantitative probability and qualitative purposeful sampling are combined as independent sampling procedures or jointly (e.g., a survey with both closed- ended and open-ended responses)\n• Multilevel sampling, in which sampling occurs in two or more levels or units of analysis\n• Sampling using any combination of the foregoing strategies\n• Include detailed procedures in your visual model. For example, in a sequential explanatory model, the general procedures are higher on the page and the detailed procedures below them, as shown in Figure 10.2a. However, the figure can be detailed even further. For example, a discussion of this approach might include describing the use of survey data collection followed by both descriptive and inferential data analysis in the first phase. Then qualitative observations and coding and thematic analysis within an ethnographic design might be mentioned for the second phase.\nDATA ANALYSIS AND VALIDATION PROCEDURES\nData analysis in mixed methods research relates to the type of research strategy chosen for the procedures. Thus, in a proposal, the procedures need to be identified within the design. However, analysis occurs both within the quantitative (descriptive and inferential numeric analysis) and the qualitative (description and thematic text or image analysis) approach and often between the two approaches. For example, some of the more popular mixed methods data analysis approaches are the following (see Caracelli & Greene, 1993; Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998):\n• Data transformation: In the concurrent strategies, a researcher may quantify the qualitative data. This involves creating codes and themes qualitatively, then counting the number of times they occur in the text data (or possibly the extent of talk about a code or theme by counting lines or sentences). This quantification of qualitative data then enables a researcher to compare quantitative results with the qualitative data. Alternatively, an inquirer may qualify quantitative data. For instance, in a factor analysis of data from a scale on an instrument, the researcher may create factors or themes that then can be compared with themes from the qualitative database.\n• Explore outliers: In a sequential model, an analysis of quantitative data in the first phase can yield extreme or outlier cases. Follow-up qualitative interviews with these outlier cases can provide insight about why they diverged from the quantitative sample.\n• Instrument development: In a sequential approach, obtain themes and specific statements from participants in an initial qualitative data collection. In the next phase, use these statements as specific items and the themes for scales to create a survey instrument that is grounded in the views of the participants. A third, final phase might be to validate the instrument with a large sample representative of a population.\n• Examine multiple levels: In a concurrent embedded model, conduct a survey at one level (e.g., with families) to gather quantitative results about a sample. At the same time, collect\n\nqualitative interviews (e.g., with individuals) to explore the phenomenon with specific individuals in the families.\n• Create a matrix: When comparing data in a concurrent type of approach, combine information from both the quantitative and qualitative data collection into a matrix. The horizontal axis of this matrix could be a quantitative categorical variable (e.g., type of provider—nurse, physician, and medical assistant) and the vertical axis would be the qualitative data (e.g., five themes about caring relationships between providers and patients). Information in the cells could be either quotes from the qualitative data, counts of the number of codes from the qualitative data, or some combination. In this way, the matrix would present an analysis of the combined qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative computer software programs provide matrix output capabilities for the mixed methods researcher (see Chapter 9).\nAnother aspect of data analysis in mixed methods research to describe in a proposal is the series of steps taken to check the validity of both the quantitative data and the accuracy of the qualitative findings. Writers on mixed methods advocate for the use of validity procedures for both the quantitative and qualitative phases of the study (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). The proposal writer discusses the validity and reliability of the scores from past uses of instruments employed in the study. In addition, potential threats to internal validity for experiments and surveys are noted (see Chapter 8). For the qualitative data, the strategies that will be used to check the accuracy of the findings need to be mentioned (see Chapter 9). These may include triangulating data sources, member checking, detailed description, or other approaches.\nAn emerging field of study is to consider how validity might be different for mixed methods studies than for a quantitative or a qualitative study. Writers have begun to develop a bilingual nomenclature for mixed methods research and have called validity legitimation (Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006, p. 55). The legitimation of the mixed methods study relates to many phases of the research process, from philosophical issues (e.g., are the philosophical positions blended into a usable form?) to inferences drawn (e.g., yield high-quality inferences) and to the value of the study for consumers (see Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006). For individuals writing a mixed methods research proposal, consider the types of validity associated with the quantitative component (see Chapter 8), validity related to the qualitative strand (see Chapter 9), and any validity issues that might arise that relate to the mixed methods approach. Validity issues in mixed methods research may relate to the types of strategies discussed in this chapter. These may relate to sample selection, sample size, follow up on contradictory results, bias in data collection, inadequate procedures, or the use of conflicting research questions (see Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007 for a discussion of these ideas).\nREPORT PRESENTATION STRUCTURE\nThe structure for the report, like the data analysis, follows the type of strategy chosen for the proposed study. Because mixed methods studies may not be familiar to audiences, it is helpful to provide some guidance as to how to structure the final report.\n• For a sequential study, mixed methods researchers typically organize the report of procedures into quantitative data collection and quantitative data analysis followed by qualitative data and collection and analysis. Then, in the conclusions or interpretation phase of the study, the researcher comments on how the qualitative findings helped to elaborate on or extend the quantitative results. Alternatively, the qualitative data collection and analysis could come first, followed by the quantitative data collection and analysis. In either structure, the\n\nwriter typically presents the project as two distinct phases, with separate headings for each phase.\n• In a concurrent study, the quantitative and qualitative data collection may be presented in separate sections, but the analysis and interpretation combines the two forms of data to seek convergence or similarities among the results. The structure of this type of mixed methods study does not make a clear distinction between the quantitative and qualitative phases.\n• In a transformative study, the structure typically involves advancing the advocacy issue in the beginning and then using either the sequential or concurrent structure as a means of organizing the content. In the end, a separate section may advance an agenda for change or reform that has developed as a result of the research."
